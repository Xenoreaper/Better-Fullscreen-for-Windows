# Better-Fullscreen-for-Windows
Makes fullscreen applications utilize another virtual desktop instead of forcing themselves over all other applications

## To Do
- ~~make windows consistently move to a new desktop~~
- ~~make windows actually move back to the primary desktop~~
- ~~solve issue of windows closing all together upon leaving fullscreen or changing their handle, hindering the removal of added desktops~~
- ~~make program not throw you back onto a different desktop because you're switching to another one~~
- ~~make multiple instances of Firefox work~~
- ~~solve issue of invalid window handles being used~~
- ~~remove desktops and window handles if they become invalid (due to program closure)~~
- improve logging
- make usage easier
- Overlay to switch through windows like Alt+Tab, replacing Win+Tab

## Issues
- Steam has a weird condition where it closes and immediately reopens in big picture, causing it to not be caught and moved correctly again
